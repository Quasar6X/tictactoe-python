# Basic Tic Tac Toe in Python :snake:
  
## :computer: About the program :computer:

This little python program is a Tic-Tac-Toe that I wrote for python learning purposes. It was originally 2 player but I changed it to Human Vs. AI. The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make a decision. Basically it is impossible to win against the AI the best you can do is a tie.
